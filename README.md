# floodnetProject16 (Under construction)

## Introduction

As part of Fl project 1.6, FloodNet contributed to the R-package 
`CSHShydRology` to include routines to perform flood frequency analysis.
These function allow the user to customize its methodology.
This package is built on top of `CSHShydRology` to further automatize the
process of estimating flood quantile following closely FloodNet recommendations.
