\title{Meta-information about HYDAT gauged stations.}
\format{An object of class \code{data.frame} with 1114 rows and 27 columns.}
\usage{
gaugedSites

\description{
The dataset contains meta-information about 1114 stations in HYDAT that have
at least 20 years of observations and a natural flood regime.
It includes catchment descriptors, candidates thresholds for peaks over
threshold (POT) analysis, p-values of trend tests and super regions.
All that information was collected during the first phase of the Floodnet
project.

\details{
The dataset contains basic information about the stations are available.
It includes the  idenfication number (\code{station}), province (\code{prov})
and geographical coordinates (\code{lon},\code{lat}), drainage area
(\code{area}) and mean annual precipitation (\code{map}).

The dataset classifies the stations into super regions based on catchment
descriptors.
The Ward's Method (\code{hc}) and the k-means (\code{km}) are combined with
the Euclidean distance to create super regions of size 6 and 12.
For example, the results of the classification into 12 super regions using
the k-means method is found in column \code{supreg_km12}.

The dataset provides seasonality measures based on the annual maximum events.
It includes, the regularity (\code{season_radius}) [0,1] and timing (in rad)
(\code{season_angle}) of the annual floods.
These values represent polar coordinates inside the unitary circle and are
converted into a cartesian system of coordinates (\code{season_x, season_y}).

The dataset includes candidates thresholds for POT analysis.
The candidates in column \code{auto} are the first thresholds that have a
p-value greater or equal to 0.25 and an exceedance rate lower than 2.5 peaks
per year (PPY).
The other suggested thresholds are associated with given PPY.
For example, \code{ppy175} is associated with 1.75 PPY.

The dataset contains p-values of trend tests to identify the stations with
time-dependent flood risk.
For AMAX, the p-value of the Mann-Kendall (\code{trend_mk}) and the Pettitt's
 test (\code{trend_pt}) are provided.
For POT, the Mann-Kendall's test is applied to the exceedances
(\code{trend_mx}). Logistic regression is used to test for trends in the
exceedance rate. The F-test is evaluated for polynomial trends of order 1 to
3 and the minimum p-value is returned (\code{trend_lg}).
